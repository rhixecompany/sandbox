# ecom Triage Context

**Date:** 2026-05-20
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Stack:** Django, Python, e-commerce (likely Stripe/PayPal), PostgreSQL
**Branch:** audit/docs-20260515
**Repo path:** `rhixecompany/ecom`

## Summary

Django-based e-commerce application. Comprehensive documentation was added in a prior
session (ARCHITECTURE.md, DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md, USER_GUIDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, AUDIT_REPORT.md,
docx package). This session added the missing CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.

## Issues Found & Fixed

| # | Issue | Action | Commit |
|---|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` present on disk but untracked | Staged and committed | `03d66ac` |

## Final State

- **Working tree:** Clean
- **Last commit:** `03d66ac` — docs: add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- **Docs:** Full docs suite — ARCHITECTURE.md, DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md, USER_GUIDE.md,
  CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, AUDIT_REPORT.md, code-docs/, .docx export
- **CI/CD:** Not observed

## Recommendations

- Add `.github/workflows/` CI workflow (lint + test + build)
- Verify `docs/node_modules/` is gitignored (currently present in docs/ — likely from docx generation)
- Add `docs/node_modules/` to `.gitignore` if not already present
