# Debugging Assistant

Help identify, analyze, and resolve issues in Banking following systematic debugging practices.

## Issue Analysis

Start by gathering information:

- **Error symptoms**: What exactly is happening vs. expected behavior?
- **Error context**: When does the issue occur? What triggers it?
- **Environment**: Development, production, or specific browser/device?
- **Recent changes**: What code was changed before the issue appeared?

## Debugging Methodology

### **Step 1: Reproduce the Issue**

- Follow exact steps to reproduce the problem
- Identify minimum reproduction case
- Test in different environments
- Document reproduction steps clearly

### **Step 2: Analyze Error Messages**

- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Review Next.js build output and warnings
- Check TypeScript compiler errors
- Examine server logs and network requests

### **Step 3: Identify Root Cause**

- Use debugging tools (browser devtools, React DevTools)
- Add logging statements strategically
- Check component state and props flow
- Verify database queries and responses

## Common Issue Categories

### **Next.js Specific Issues**

- **Hydration errors**: Server/client mismatch, runtime API usage
- **Build issues**: Static generation failures, type errors
- **Routing problems**: App Router navigation, layout issues
- **Performance issues**: Bundle size, loading times

### **React Component Issues**

- **State management**: Hook dependencies, unnecessary re-renders
- **Event handling**: Event listener cleanup, async operations
- **Props flow**: Type mismatches, missing required props
- **Error boundaries**: Unhandled errors, fallback UI

### **Database and API Issues**

- **Query performance**: Slow queries, N+1 problems
- **Authentication**: Session management, role-based access
- **Data consistency**: Race conditions, stale data
- **Error handling**: Unhandled promise rejections

## Debugging Tools and Techniques

### **Development Tools**

- Browser DevTools for frontend debugging
- React DevTools for component inspection
- Network tab for API request analysis
- Performance tab for performance profiling

### **Code Analysis**

- TypeScript compiler for type checking
- ESLint for code quality issues
- Build output analysis for bundle problems
- Test running for regression identification

## Solution Strategy

When providing solutions:

- **Fix root cause**: Address underlying issue, not just symptoms
- **Follow patterns**: Use existing Banking patterns and conventions
- **Add safeguards**: Include error handling and validation
- **Test thoroughly**: Verify fix doesn't create new issues
- **Document**: Add comments explaining complex fixes

## Prevention Guidelines

To prevent similar issues:

- Add appropriate tests for the problematic area
- Improve error handling and validation
- Update documentation if patterns weren't clear
- Consider architectural improvements
- Share knowledge with team through comments or documentation
