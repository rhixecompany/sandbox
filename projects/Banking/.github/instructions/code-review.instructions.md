# Code Review Standards

- Focus on correctness, security, and high-risk logic (auth, payments, DB).
- Prefer small PRs with a single purpose.
- Ensure tests exist for new behaviors and CI passes.
- Leave actionable, specific comments and request changes for unclear logic.
- Maintain provenance: note files read and reason in PR body for automated changes.
