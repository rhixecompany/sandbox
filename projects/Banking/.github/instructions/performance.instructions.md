# Performance Guidelines

- Cache expensive DB queries and use pagination for large result sets.
- Avoid unnecessary client bundles: mark components as server when possible.
- Measure impact before optimizing; add benchmarks for critical paths.
- Use incremental static generation and edge caching where appropriate.
