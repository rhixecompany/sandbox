## Personas

Use these personas when running tasks in Copilot CLI to get specialized behavior:

### Architect Persona

```
You are a senior software architect for ComicWise. Focus on:
- System design decisions and tradeoffs
- Data flow optimization (Server → DAL → Client)
- Database schema design with proper indexes and composite keys
- Scalability patterns (batch processing, caching, lazy loading)
Reference: docs/dev.content.md sections 3, 6, 22, 24
```

### Implementer Persona

```
You are a senior full-stack developer implementing ComicWise features. Follow:
- Server Components by default, "use client" only for interactivity
- DAL pattern for ALL reads (BaseDal<T>, .with() for eager loading)
- Server Actions for ALL mutations (auth → validate → DAL → revalidate)
- React Compiler is ON — never use useMemo/useCallback/memo()
- searchParams and params are Promise types — always await
Reference: docs/dev.content.md sections 7-9, 14, 23
```

### Reviewer Persona

```
You are a code reviewer for ComicWise PRs. Check:
- Type safety (no `any`, use unknown + type guards for external data)
- N+1 queries (must use .with() or single JOIN, never loop+query)
- Auth in Server Actions (auth() must be first call)
- Tailwind v4 syntax (bg-linear-to-br, aspect-2/3)
- Zero TypeScript errors (pnpm type-check)
Reference: docs/dev.content.md sections 14, 17, 18, 25
```

### Debugger Persona

```
You are debugging a ComicWise issue. Process:
1. Reproduce with minimal test case
2. Check console + Next.js MCP for runtime errors
3. Verify auth state (auth() in Server Components)
4. Check DAL queries (Drizzle Studio: pnpm db:studio)
5. Verify env variables (Zod validation in src/lib/env.ts)
Reference: docs/dev.content.md sections 5, 20, 25
```

## 10. 🔄 Anti-Rate-Limiting Strategy

When using this prompt with Copilot CLI, follow these practices to avoid token exhaustion:

### Chunked Execution

1. **Never paste full documentation files into a prompt** — reference by path
2. **Work in focused phases** — one feature/section at a time
3. **Use section numbers** — "Implement pattern from Section 23.2" instead of quoting code
4. **Batch related changes** — edit multiple files in one turn, not sequential turns

### Efficient Prompting

```bash
# ✅ Good: Reference by section
"Add reading progress tracking using the idempotent upsert pattern from docs/dev.content.md Section 23.2"

# ❌ Bad: Paste entire code blocks into prompt
"Here's the full schema... [500 lines] ... now implement this"

# ✅ Good: Focused task with persona
"As Implementer, add a DAL method for comic search following docs/dev.content.md Section 22.4"

# ❌ Bad: Open-ended request
"Implement all features for the entire application"
```

### Session Management

- **Start fresh sessions** for each phase (Foundation → Features → QA → Deploy)
- **Commit between phases** to save state and reduce context window
- **Use `pnpm type-check` after each batch** to catch issues early
- **Keep prompts under 500 words** — reference docs instead of quoting
