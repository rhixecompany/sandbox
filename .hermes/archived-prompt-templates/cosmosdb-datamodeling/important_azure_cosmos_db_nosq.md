## Important Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL Context

### Understanding Aggregate-Oriented Design

In aggregate-oriented design, Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL offers multiple levels of aggregation:

1. Multi-Document Container Aggregates

  Multiple related entities grouped by sharing the same partition key but stored as separate documents with different IDs. This provides:

   • Efficient querying of related data with a single SQL query
   • Transactional consistency within the partition using stored procedures/triggers
   • Flexibility to access individual documents
   • No size constraints per document (each document limited to 2MB)

2. Single Document Aggregates

  Multiple entities combined into a single Cosmos DB document. This provides:

   • Atomic updates across all data in the aggregate
   • Single point read retrieval for all data. Make sure to reference the document by id and partition key via API (example `ReadItemAsync<Order>(id: "order0103", partitionKey: new PartitionKey("TimS1234"));` instead of using a query with `SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.id = "order0103" AND c.partitionKey = "TimS1234"` for point reads examples)
   • Subject to 2MB document size limit

When designing aggregates, consider both levels based on your requirements.

### Constants for Reference

• **Cosmos DB document limit**: 2MB (hard constraint)
• **Autoscale mode**: Automatically scales between 10% and 100% of max RU/s
• **Request Unit (RU) costs**:
  • Point read (1KB document): 1 RU
  • Query (1KB document): ~2-5 RUs depending on complexity
  • Write (1KB document): ~5 RUs
  • Update (1KB document): ~7 RUs (Update more expensive then create operation)
  • Delete (1KB document): ~5 RUs
  • **CRITICAL**: Large documents (>10KB) have proportionally higher RU costs
  • **Cross-partition query overhead**: ~2.5 RU per physical partition scanned
  • **Realistic RU estimation**: Always calculate based on actual document sizes, not theoretical 1KB
• **Storage**: $0.25/GB-month
• **Throughput**: $0.008/RU per hour (manual), $0.012/RU per hour (autoscale)
• **Monthly seconds**: 2,592,000

### Key Design Constraints

• Document size limit: 2MB (hard limit affecting aggregate boundaries)
• Partition throughput: Up to 10,000 RU/s per physical partition
• Partition key cardinality: Aim for 100+ distinct values to avoid hot partitions (higher the cardinality, the better)
• **Physical partition math**: Total data size ÷ 50GB = number of physical partitions
• Cross-partition queries: Higher RU cost and latency compared to single-partition queries and RU cost per query will increase based on number of physical partitions. AVOID modeling cross-partition queries for high-frequency patterns or very large datasets.
• **Cross-partition overhead**: Each physical partition adds ~2.5 RU base cost to cross-partition queries
• **Massive scale implications**: 100+ physical partitions make cross-partition queries extremely expensive and not scalable.
• Index overhead: Every indexed property consumes storage and write RUs
• Update patterns: Frequent updates to indexed properties or full Document replace increase RU costs (and the bigger Document size, bigger the impact of update RU increase)
