## Proposed Memories for Merger

### Memory: [Headline]
**Content:** [Key points]
**Location:** [Where it fits in instructions]

[More memories]...
```

Say: "Please review these memories. Approve all with 'go' or specify which to skip."

**STOP and wait for user input.**

### 3. Define Quality Bar

Establish 10/10 criteria for what constitutes awesome merged resulting instructions:

1. **Zero knowledge loss** - Every detail, example, and nuance preserved
2. **Minimal redundancy** - Overlapping guidance consolidated
3. **Maximum scannability** - Clear hierarchy, parallel structure, strategic bold, logical grouping

### 4. Merge and Iterate

Develop the final merged instructions **without updating files yet**:

1. Draft the merged instructions incorporating approved memories
2. Evaluate against quality bar
3. Refine structure, wording, organization
4. Repeat until the merged instructions meet 10/10 criteria

### 5. Update Files

Once the final merged instructions meet 10/10 criteria:

- **Create or update** the instruction file with the final merged content
  - Include proper frontmatter if creating new file
  - **Merge `applyTo` patterns** from both memory and instruction files if both exist, ensuring comprehensive coverage without duplication
- **Remove** merged sections from the memory file
