## Goal

Create an Architectural Decision Record (ADR) document for AI-optimized decision documentation.

## Context

Use when you need to work on the current workspace or task.

## Inputs

- The current workspace, repo, or document state.
- The specific request, diff, spec, or files provided by the user.
- Any prompt variables, paths, or constraints named in the original instructions.

## Outputs

- A complete result that matches the prompt's purpose.
- A concise verification note when the task benefits from one.

## Rules

- Follow the prompt literally and prefer evidence from the current workspace.
- Keep the response structured, deterministic, and easy to act on.
- Avoid changing unrelated files or adding unnecessary scope.
- If something is unclear, state the assumption instead of guessing.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Intake
- Read the request and identify the exact scope.
- Locate the relevant files, diffs, or references.

### Phase 2: Execute
- Perform the requested work with the smallest safe change set.
- Keep the steps explicit and reproducible.

### Phase 3: Verify
- Check the result against the goal, rules, and inputs.
- Confirm the output is usable and complete.

### Phase 4: Hand off
- Return the final artifact or findings clearly.
- Stop once the requested result is delivered.

## Inputs

- **Context**: `${input:Context}`
- **Decision**: `${input:Decision}`
- **Alternatives**: `${input:Alternatives}`
- **Stakeholders**: `${input:Stakeholders}`

## Input Validation

If any of the required inputs are not provided or cannot be determined from the conversation history, ask the user to provide the missing information before proceeding with ADR generation.

## Requirements

- Use precise, unambiguous language
- Follow standardized ADR format with front matter
- Include both positive and negative consequences
- Document alternatives with rejection rationale
- Structure for machine parsing and human reference
- Use coded bullet points (3-4 letter codes + 3-digit numbers) for multi-item sections

The ADR must be saved in the `/docs/adr/` directory using the naming convention: `adr-NNNN-[title-slug].md`, where NNNN is the next sequential 4-digit number (e.g., `adr-0001-database-selection.md`).

## Required Documentation Structure

The documentation file must follow the template below, ensuring that all sections are filled out appropriately. The front matter for the markdown should be structured correctly as per the example following:

```md
---
title: "ADR-NNNN: [Decision Title]"
status: "Proposed"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
authors: "[Stakeholder Names/Roles]"
tags: ["architecture", "decision"]
supersedes: ""
superseded_by: ""
---

# ADR-NNNN: [Decision Title]

## Status

**Proposed** | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded | Deprecated

## Context

[Problem statement, technical constraints, business requirements, and environmental factors requiring this decision.]

## Decision

[Chosen solution with clear rationale for selection.]

## Consequences

### Positive

- **POS-001**: [Beneficial outcomes and advantages]
- **POS-002**: [Performance, maintainability, scalability improvements]
- **POS-003**: [Alignment with architectural principles]

### Negative

- **NEG-001**: [Trade-offs, limitations, drawbacks]
- **NEG-002**: [Technical debt or complexity introduced]
- **NEG-003**: [Risks and future challenges]

## Alternatives Considered

### [Alternative 1 Name]

- **ALT-001**: **Description**: [Brief technical description]
- **ALT-002**: **Rejection Reason**: [Why this option was not selected]

### [Alternative 2 Name]

- **ALT-003**: **Description**: [Brief technical description]
- **ALT-004**: **Rejection Reason**: [Why this option was not selected]

## Implementation Notes

- **IMP-001**: [Key implementation considerations]
- **IMP-002**: [Migration or rollout strategy if applicable]
- **IMP-003**: [Monitoring and success criteria]

## References

- **REF-001**: [Related ADRs]
- **REF-002**: [External documentation]
- **REF-003**: [Standards or frameworks referenced]
