# Create Specification

Your goal is to create a new specification file for `${input:SpecPurpose}`.

The specification file must define the requirements, constraints, and interfaces for the solution components in a manner that is clear, unambiguous, and structured for effective use by Generative AIs. Follow established documentation standards and ensure the content is machine-readable and self-contained.

## Best Practices for AI-Ready Specifications

> - Use precise, explicit, and unambiguous language.
> - Clearly distinguish between requirements, constraints, and recommendations.

> **Full content:** `templates/create-specification/best_practices_for_ai-rea.md`

## 1. Purpose & Scope

[Provide a clear, concise description of the specification's purpose and the scope of its application. State the intended audience and any assumptions.]

## 2. Definitions

[List and define all acronyms, abbreviations, and domain-specific terms used in this specification.]

## 3. Requirements, Constraints & Guidelines

[Explicitly list all requirements, constraints, rules, and guidelines. Use bullet points or tables for clarity.]

- **REQ-001**: Requirement 1
- **SEC-001**: Security Requirement 1
- **[3 LETTERS]-001**: Other Requirement 1
- **CON-001**: Constraint 1
- **GUD-001**: Guideline 1
- **PAT-001**: Pattern to follow 1

## 4. Interfaces & Data Contracts

[Describe the interfaces, APIs, data contracts, or integration points. Use tables or code blocks for schemas and examples.]

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

[Define clear, testable acceptance criteria for each requirement using Given-When-Then format where appropriate.]

- **AC-001**: Given [context], When [action], Then [expected outcome]
- **AC-002**: The system shall [specific behavior] when [condition]
- **AC-003**: [Additional acceptance criteria as needed]

## 6. Test Automation Strategy

[Define the testing approach, frameworks, and automation requirements.]

- **Test Levels**: Unit, Integration, End-to-End
- **Frameworks**: MSTest, FluentAssertions, Moq (for .NET applications)
- **Test Data Management**: [approach for test data creation and cleanup]
- **CI/CD Integration**: [automated testing in GitHub Actions pipelines]
- **Coverage Requirements**: [minimum code coverage thresholds]
- **Performance Testing**: [approach for load and performance testing]

## 7. Rationale & Context

[Explain the reasoning behind the requirements, constraints, and guidelines. Provide context for design decisions.]

## 8. Dependencies & External Integrations

> [Define the external systems, services, and architectural dependencies required 
> - **EXT-001**: [External system name] - [Purpose and integration type]

> **Full content:** `templates/create-specification/8_dependencies__external_.md`

## 9. Examples & Edge Cases

    ```code
    // Code snippet or data example demonstrating the correct application of the guidelines, including edge cases
    ```

## 10. Validation Criteria

[List the criteria or tests that must be satisfied for compliance with this specification.]
