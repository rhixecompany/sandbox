## Enhanced Aggregate Analysis

For each potential aggregate, analyze:

### [Entity1 + Entity2] Container Item Analysis

- **Access Correlation**: [X]% of queries need both entities together
- **Query Patterns**:
  - Entity1 only: [X]% of queries
  - Entity2 only: [X]% of queries
  - Both together: [X]% of queries
- **Size Constraints**: Combined max size [X]MB, growth pattern
- **Update Patterns**: [Independent/Related] update frequencies
- **Decision**: [Single Document/Multi-Document Container/Separate Containers]
- **Justification**: [Reasoning based on access correlation and constraints]

### Identifying Relationship Check

For each parent-child relationship, verify:

- **Child Independence**: Can child entity exist without parent?
- **Access Pattern**: Do you always have parent_id when querying children?
- **Current Design**: Are you planning cross-partition queries for parent→child queries?

If answers are No/Yes/Yes → Use identifying relationship (partition key=parent_id) instead of separate container with cross-partition queries.

Example:

### User + Orders Container Item Analysis

- **Access Correlation**: 45% of queries need user profile with recent orders
- **Query Patterns**:
  - User profile only: 55% of queries
  - Orders only: 20% of queries
  - Both together: 45% of queries (AP31 pattern)
- **Size Constraints**: User 2KB + 5 recent orders 15KB = 17KB total, bounded growth
- **Update Patterns**: User updates monthly, orders created daily - acceptable coupling
- **Identifying Relationship**: Orders cannot exist without Users, always have user_id when querying orders
- **Decision**: Multi-Document Container (UserOrders container)
- **Justification**: 45% joint access + identifying relationship eliminates need for cross-partition queries
