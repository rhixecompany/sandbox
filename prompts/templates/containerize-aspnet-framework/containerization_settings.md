# Containerization Settings

> Extracted from `containerize-aspnet-framework.prompt.md`.

## Containerization Settings

This section of the prompt contains the specific settings and configurations required for containerizing the ASP.NET (.NET Framework) application. Prior to running this prompt, ensure that the settings are filled out with the necessary information. Note that in many cases, only the first few settings are required. Later settings can be left as defaults if they do not apply to the project being containerized.

Any settings that are not specified will be set to default values. The default values are provided in `[square brackets]`.

3. Windows Server version to use:
   - `[2022, 2019, or 2016 (Default 2022)]`

4. Custom base image for the build stage of the Docker image ("None" to use standard Microsoft base image):
   - `[Specify base image to use for build stage (Default None)]`

5. Custom base image for the run stage of the Docker image ("None" to use standard Microsoft base image):
   - `[Specify base image to use for run stage (Default None)]`

### Dependencies

1. .NET assemblies that should be registered in the GAC in the container image:
