## Adding DELETE Operations

### Simple DELETE

```typescript
/**
 * Delete an item.
 * @param id The ID of the item to delete
 */
@route("/items/{id}")
@delete op deleteItem(@path id: integer): void;
```

### DELETE with Confirmation

```typescript
/**
 * Delete an item with confirmation.
 */
@route("/items/{id}")
@delete
@capabilities(#{
  confirmation: #{
    type: "AdaptiveCard",
    title: "Delete Item",
    body: """
    ⚠️ Are you sure you want to delete item #{{ function.parameters.id }}?
    This action cannot be undone.
    """
  }
})
op deleteItem(@path id: integer): void;
```
