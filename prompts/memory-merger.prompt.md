## Goal

Merges mature lessons from a domain memory file into its instruction file. Syntax: `/memory-merger >domain [scope]` where scope is `global` (default), `user`, `workspace`, or `ws`.

## Context

Use when you need to memory merger for the current workspace or task.

## Inputs

- The current workspace, repo, or document state.
- The specific request, diff, spec, or files provided by the user.
- Any prompt variables, paths, or constraints named in the original instructions.

## Outputs

- A complete result that matches the prompt's purpose.
- A concise verification note when the task benefits from one.

## Rules
> Core rules: [`prompts/templates/_shared/rules-core.md`](../templates/_shared/rules-core.md)


- Follow the prompt literally and prefer evidence from the current workspace.
- Keep the response structured, deterministic, and easy to act on.
- Avoid changing unrelated files or adding unnecessary scope.
- If something is unclear, state the assumption instead of guessing.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Intake
- Read the request and identify the exact scope.
- Locate the relevant files, diffs, or references.

### Phase 2: Execute
- Perform the requested work with the smallest safe change set.
- Keep the steps explicit and reproducible.

### Phase 3: Verify
- Check the result against the goal, rules, and inputs.
- Confirm the output is usable and complete.

### Phase 4: Hand off
- Return the final artifact or findings clearly.
- Stop once the requested result is delivered.

## Scopes

Memory instructions can be stored in two scopes:

- **Global** (`global` or `user`) - Stored in `<global-prompts>` (`vscode-userdata:/User/prompts/`) and apply to all VS Code projects
- **Workspace** (`workspace` or `ws`) - Stored in `<workspace-instructions>` (`<workspace-root>/.github/instructions/`) and apply only to the current project

Default scope is **global**.

Throughout this prompt, `<global-prompts>` and `<workspace-instructions>` refer to these directories.

## Syntax

```
/memory-merger >domain-name [scope]
```

- `>domain-name` - Required. The domain to merge (e.g., `>clojure`, `>git-workflow`, `>prompt-engineering`)
- `[scope]` - Optional. One of: `global`, `user` (both mean global), `workspace`, or `ws`. Defaults to `global`

**Examples:**

- `/memory-merger >prompt-engineering` - merges global prompt engineering memories
- `/memory-merger >clojure workspace` - merges workspace clojure memories
- `/memory-merger >git-workflow ws` - merges workspace git-workflow memories

## Process

### 1. Parse Input and Read Files

- **Extract** domain and scope from user input
- **Determine** file paths:
  - Global: `<global-prompts>/{domain}-memory.instructions.md` → `<global-prompts>/{domain}.instructions.md`
  - Workspace: `<workspace-instructions>/{domain}-memory.instructions.md` → `<workspace-instructions>/{domain}.instructions.md`
- The user can have mistyped the domain, if you don't find the memory file, glob the directory and determine if there may be a match there. Ask the user for input if in doubt.
- **Read** both files (memory file must exist; instruction file may not)

### 2. Analyze and Propose

Review all memory sections and present them for merger consideration:

```
## Proposed Memories for Merger

> ### Memory: [Headline]
> **Content:** [Key points]

> **Full content:** `templates/memory-merger/proposed_memories_for_mer.md`

## Example

```
User: "/memory-merger >clojure"

Agent:
1. Reads clojure-memory.instructions.md and clojure.instructions.md
2. Proposes 3 memories for merger
3. [STOPS]

User: "go"

Agent:
4. Defines quality bar for 10/10
5. Merges new instructions candidate, iterates to 10/10
6. Updates clojure.instructions.md
7. Cleans clojure-memory.instructions.md
```
