## GoalComprehensive technology-agnostic prompt for analyzing and documenting project folder structures. Auto-detects project types (.NET, Java, React, Angular, Python, Node.js, Flutter), generates detailed blueprints with visualization options, naming conventions, file placement patterns, and extension templates for maintaining consistent code organization across diverse technology stacks.

## ContextUse when you need to work on the current workspace or task.

## Inputs- The current workspace, repo, or document state.- The specific request, diff, spec, or files provided by the user.- Any prompt variables, paths, or constraints named in the original instructions.

## Outputs- A complete result that matches the prompt's purpose.- A concise verification note when the task benefits from one.

## Rules>> Core rules: [`templates/_shared/rules-core.md`](templates/_shared/rules-core.md)- Follow the prompt literally and prefer evidence from the current workspace.- Keep the response structured, deterministic, and easy to act on.- Avoid changing unrelated files or adding unnecessary scope.- If something is unclear, state the assumption instead of guessing.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Intake- Read the request and identify the exact scope.- Locate the relevant files, diffs, or references.

### Phase 2: Execute- Perform the requested work with the smallest safe change set.- Keep the steps explicit and reproducible.

### Phase 3: Verify- Check the result against the goal, rules, and inputs.- Confirm the output is usable and complete.

### Phase 4: Hand off- Return the final artifact or findings clearly.- Stop once the requested result is delivered.

## Template ReferencesDetailed templates in `templates/folder-structure-blueprint-generator/`:- `configuration_variables.md`- `generated_prompt.md`

## Personas

See [`templates/_shared/personas.md`](templates/_shared/personas.md) for shared persona templates.

| Persona | When to Use |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Developer** | Implementation, debugging, refactoring |
| **Reviewer** | Code review, quality assurance |
| **User** | General purpose, operations |


## Personality

See [`templates/_shared/personality.md`](templates/_shared/personality.md) for shared personality guidelines.

- **Tone**: Direct, practical, actionable
- **Style**: Structured with clear steps and verification
- **Avoid**: Ambiguity, assumptions, scope creep
- **Encourage**: Evidence-based decisions, minimal changes


## Context

Use when implementing, modifying, or debugging code. Read the codebase first, understand patterns, then apply changes with tests.


## Rules

See core rules: [`templates/_shared/rules-core.md`](templates/_shared/rules-core.md)

### Domain Rules

- Read existing code before writing new code.
- Match project conventions and style.
- Add tests for new functionality.

### Standing Rules

1. **Map before touch** — Understand before making changes.
2. **Smallest safe change** — Minimal change that achieves the goal.
3. **Verify before claim** — Test before reporting complete.
4. **Report blockers** — State clearly when something fails.


## Phases

### Phase 1: Intake
- Read the request and identify scope.
- Locate relevant files, diffs, references.

### Phase 2: Execute
- Perform work with smallest safe change set.
- Keep steps explicit and reproducible.

### Phase 3: Verify
- Check result against goal, rules, inputs.
- Confirm output is usable and complete.

### Phase 4: Hand Off
- Return final artifact or findings clearly.
- Stop once the requested result is delivered.


## Best Practices

See [`templates/_shared/best-practices.md`](templates/_shared/best-practices.md) for cross-cutting best practices.

1. **DRY** — Reference shared templates instead of duplicating content.
2. **Structured output** — Use clear sections with consistent heading levels.
3. **Verification gates** — Always verify before claiming completion.
4. **Minimal changes** — Fix root cause, not symptoms.


## Verification Checklist

| # | Gate | Criterion |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | Scope | Change matches the original request |
| 2 | Quality | Meets project standards |
| 3 | Tests | Tests pass (if applicable) |
| 4 | Regression | No unintended side effects |
| 5 | Docs | Changes documented if needed |


## Dependencies

See [`templates/_shared/deps-core.md`](templates/_shared/deps-core.md) for shared dependency patterns.

## Goal

Comprehensive technology-agnostic prompt for analyzing and documenting project folder structures. Auto-detects project types (.NET, Java, React, Angular, Python, Node.js, Flutter), generates detailed blueprints with visualization options, naming conventions, file placement patterns, and extension templates for maintaining consistent code organization across diverse technology stacks.


## Subgoals

1. **Prepare** — Understand requirements and prerequisites.
2. **Execute** — Follow structured workflow with incremental progress.
3. **Verify** — Confirm output meets requirements and standards.
4. **Document** — Record results, decisions, and lessons learned.


## Skills Required

See [`templates/_shared/skills-table-core.md`](templates/_shared/skills-table-core.md) for shared skills table.

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `using-superpowers` | Foundational skill workflow |
| `systematic-debugging` | Root cause analysis and fix |
| `git-patch-management` | Patch creation and management |
| `executing-plans` | Execute plans step by step |
| `verification-before-completion` | Validate before claiming done |


## MCP Servers & Tools

The following MCP servers and tools are available for this task. Use them in preference to native equivalents per MCP-first tooling policy.

| `ast-grep` | AST-based code search and replace |
| `filesystem` | File read/write operations |
| `sequential-thinking` | Structured reasoning for complex problems |
| `fetch` | Web page content extraction |
| `playwright` | Browser automation for interactive pages |
| `github` | GitHub API operations |



## Tasks

- [ ] Understand requirements and scope
- [ ] Plan approach and identify resources
- [ ] Execute work incrementally
- [ ] Verify against acceptance criteria
- [ ] Document results and decisions
