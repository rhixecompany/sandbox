## Goal

Create an Architectural Decision Record (ADR) document for AI-optimized decision documentation.

## Context

Use when you need to work on the current workspace or task.

## Input

s

- The current workspace, repo, or document state.
- The specific request, diff, spec, or files provided by the user.
- Any prompt variables, paths, or constraints named in the original instructions.

## Output

s

- A complete result that matches the prompt's purpose.
- A concise verification note when the task benefits from one.

## Rules

> Core rules: [`templates/_shared/rules-core.md`](templates/_shared/rules-core.md)

- Follow the prompt literally and prefer evidence from the current workspace.
- Keep the response structured, deterministic, and easy to act on.
- Avoid changing unrelated files or adding unnecessary scope.
- If something is unclear, state the assumption instead of guessing.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Intake

- Read the request and identify the exact scope.
- Locate the relevant files, diffs, or references.

### Phase 2: Execute

- Perform the requested work with the smallest safe change set.
- Keep the steps explicit and reproducible.

### Phase 3: Verify

- Check the result against the goal, rules, and inputs.
- Confirm the output is usable and complete.

### Phase 4: Hand off

- Return the final artifact or findings clearly.
- Stop once the requested result is delivered.

## Input

s

- **Context**: `${input:Context}`
- **Decision**: `${input:Decision}`
- **Alternatives**: `${input:Alternatives}`
- **Stakeholders**: `${input:Stakeholders}`

## Input ValidationIf any of the required inputs are not provided or cannot be determined from the conversation history, ask the user to provide the missing information before proceeding with ADR generation.

## Requirements

- Use precise, unambiguous language
- Follow standardized ADR format with front matter
- Include both positive and negative consequences
- Document alternatives with rejection rationale
- Structure for machine parsing and human reference
- Use coded bullet points (3-4 letter codes + 3-digit numbers) for multi-item sectionsThe ADR must be saved in the `/docs/adr/` directory using the naming convention: `adr-NNNN-[title-slug].md`, where NNNN is the next sequential 4-digit number (e.g., `adr-0001-database-selection.md`).

## Required Documentation Structure

The documentation file must follow the template below, ensuring that all sections are filled out appropriately. The front matter for the markdown should be structured correctly as per the example following:```md---title: "ADR-NNNN: [Decision Title]"status: "Proposed"date: "YYYY-MM-DD"authors: "[Stakeholder Names/Roles]"supersedes: ""superseded_by: ""---# ADR-NNNN: [Decision Title]

## Status

**Proposed** | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded | Deprecated

## Context

[Problem statement, technical constraints, business requirements, and environmental factors requiring this decision.]

## Decision

[Chosen solution with clear rationale for selection.]

## Consequences

### Positive

- **POS-001**: [Beneficial outcomes and advantages]
- **POS-002**: [Performance, maintainability, scalability improvements]
- **POS-003**: [Alignment with architectural principles]

### Negative

- **NEG-001**: [Trade-offs, limitations, drawbacks]
- **NEG-002**: [Technical debt or complexity introduced]
- **NEG-003**: [Risks and future challenges]

## Alternatives Considered

### [Alternative 1 Name]

- **ALT-001**: **Description**: [Brief technical description]- **ALT-002**: **Rejection Reason**: [Why this option was not selected]

### [Alternative 2 Name]

- **ALT-003**: **Description**: [Brief technical description]- **ALT-004**: **Rejection Reason**: [Why this option was not selected]

## Implementation Notes

- **IMP-001**: [Key implementation considerations]- **IMP-002**: [Migration or rollout strategy if applicable]- **IMP-003**: [Monitoring and success criteria]

## Reference

s

- **REF-001**: [Related ADRs]
- **REF-002**: [External documentation]
- **REF-003**: [Standards or frameworks referenced]```````

## Template References

Templates in `templates/create-architectural-decision-record/`:- `phases.md`- `required_documentation_st.md`

## Personas

See [`templates/_shared/personas.md`](templates/_shared/personas.md) for shared persona templates.

| Persona | When to Use |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Developer** | Implementation, debugging, refactoring |
| **Reviewer** | Code review, quality assurance |
| **User** | General purpose, operations |

## Personality

See [`templates/_shared/personality.md`](templates/_shared/personality.md) for shared personality guidelines.

- **Tone**: Direct, practical, actionable
- **Style**: Structured with clear steps and verification
- **Avoid**: Ambiguity, assumptions, scope creep
- **Encourage**: Evidence-based decisions, minimal changes

## Context

Use when fixing, repairing, or synchronizing files or configs. Diagnose first, apply minimal changes, verify each fix.

## Rules

See core rules: [`templates/_shared/rules-core.md`](templates/_shared/rules-core.md)

### Domain Rules

- Fix root causes, not symptoms.
- Check siblings for the same flaw.
- Restore from git clean before retrying.

### Standing Rules

1. **Map before touch** — Understand before making changes.
2. **Smallest safe change** — Minimal change that achieves the goal.
3. **Verify before claim** — Test before reporting complete.
4. **Report blockers** — State clearly when something fails.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Intake

- Read the request and identify scope.
- Locate relevant files, diffs, references.

### Phase 2: Execute

- Perform work with smallest safe change set.
- Keep steps explicit and reproducible.

### Phase 3: Verify

- Check result against goal, rules, inputs.
- Confirm output is usable and complete.

### Phase 4: Hand Off

- Return final artifact or findings clearly.
- Stop once the requested result is delivered.

## Best Practices

See [`templates/_shared/best-practices.md`](templates/_shared/best-practices.md) for cross-cutting best practices.

1. **DRY** — Reference shared templates instead of duplicating content.
2. **Structured output** — Use clear sections with consistent heading levels.
3. **Verification gates** — Always verify before claiming completion.
4. **Minimal changes** — Fix root cause, not symptoms.

## Verification Checklist

| # | Gate | Criterion |
| --- | ------ | ----------- |
| 1 | Scope | Change matches the original request |
| 2 | Quality | Meets project standards |
| 3 | Tests | Tests pass (if applicable) |
| 4 | Regression | No unintended side effects |
| 5 | Docs | Changes documented if needed |

## Dependencies

See [`templates/_shared/deps-core.md`](templates/_shared/deps-core.md) for shared dependency patterns.

## Goal

Create an Architectural Decision Record (ADR) document for AI-optimized decision documentation.

## Subgoals

1. **Prepare** — Understand requirements and prerequisites.
2. **Execute** — Follow structured workflow with incremental progress.
3. **Verify** — Confirm output meets requirements and standards.
4. **Document** — Record results, decisions, and lessons learned.
