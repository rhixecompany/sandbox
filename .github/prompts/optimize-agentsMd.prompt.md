## Goal

Use this prompt to handle the optimize agentsmd workflow.

## Context

Use when you need to optimize agentsmd for the current workspace or task.

## Inputs

- The current workspace, repo, or document state.
- The specific request, diff, spec, or files provided by the user.
- Any prompt variables, paths, or constraints named in the original instructions.

## Outputs

- A complete result that matches the prompt's purpose.
- A concise verification note summarizing what was changed, assumptions made, and any missing sources.

## Rules

> Core rules: [`templates/_shared/rules-core.md`](templates/_shared/rules-core.md)

- Follow the prompt literally and prefer evidence from the current workspace.
- Keep the chat response structured, deterministic, and easy to act on; if the artifact is large, provide a concise summary plus the file update.
- Avoid changing unrelated files or adding unnecessary scope.
- If something is unclear and non-blocking, state the assumption explicitly; if it blocks correctness, ask for clarification or mark it as "not present".

## Phases

The outer phases map to the source prompt as follows: Phase 1 Intake = Phase 1, Phase 2 Execute = Phases 2-3, Phase 3 Verify = Phase 4, Phase 4 Hand off = final presentation.

### Phase 1: Intake

- Read the request and identify the exact scope.
- Locate the relevant files, diffs, or references.

### Phase 2: Execute

- Produce the AGENTS.md rewrite/update described in the source prompt details; do not constrain scope when full coverage updates are required.
- Keep the steps explicit and reproducible.

### Phase 3: Verify

- Check the result against the goal, rules, and inputs.
- Confirm the output is usable and complete.

### Phase 4: Hand off

- Return the final artifact or findings .
- Stop once the requested result is delivered.

## Template References

Detailed templates in `templates/optimize-agentsMd/`:- `plan_comprehensive_agentsmd_fo.md`

## Personas

See [`templates/_shared/personas.md`](templates/_shared/personas.md) for shared persona templates.

| Persona | When to Use |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Developer** | Implementation, debugging, refactoring |
| **Reviewer** | Code review, quality assurance |
| **User** | General purpose, operations |

## Personality

See [`templates/_shared/personality.md`](templates/_shared/personality.md) for shared personality guidelines.

- **Tone**: Direct, practical, actionable
- **Style**: Structured with clear steps and verification
- **Avoid**: Ambiguity, assumptions, scope creep
- **Encourage**: Evidence-based decisions, minimal changes

## Best Practices

See [`templates/_shared/best-practices.md`](templates/_shared/best-practices.md) for cross-cutting best practices.

1. **DRY** — Reference shared templates instead of duplicating content.
2. **Structured output** — Use clear sections with consistent heading levels.
3. **Verification gates** — Always verify before claiming completion.
4. **Minimal changes** — Fix root cause, not symptoms.

## Verification Checklist

| # | Gate | Criterion |
| --- | ------ | ----------- |
| 1 | Scope | Change matches the original request |
| 2 | Quality | Meets project standards |
| 3 | Tests | Tests pass (if applicable) |
| 4 | Regression | No unintended side effects |
| 5 | Docs | Changes documented if needed |

## Dependencies

See [`templates/_shared/deps-core.md`](templates/_shared/deps-core.md) for shared dependency patterns.

## Subgoals

1. **Prepare** — Understand requirements and prerequisites.
2. **Execute** — Follow structured workflow with incremental progress.
3. **Verify** — Confirm output meets requirements and standards.
4. **Document** — Record results, decisions, and lessons learned.

## Skills Required

See [`templates/_shared/skills-table-core.md`](templates/_shared/skills-table-core.md) for shared skills table.

| Skill | Purpose |
| ------- | --------- |
| `using-superpowers` | Foundational skill workflow |
| `systematic-debugging` | Root cause analysis and fix |
| `git-patch-management` | Patch creation and management |
| `executing-plans` | Execute plans step by step |
| `verification-before-completion` | Validate before claiming done |

## MCP Servers & Tools

The following MCP servers and tools are available for this task. Use them in preference to native equivalents per MCP-first tooling policy.

| `ast-grep` | AST-based code search and replace |
| `filesystem` | File read/write operations |
| `sequential-thinking` | Structured reasoning for complex problems |
| `fetch` | Web page content extraction |
| `playwright` | Browser automation for interactive pages |
| `github` | GitHub API operations |

## Tasks

- [ ] Understand requirements and scope
- [ ] Plan approach and identify resources
- [ ] Execute work incrementally
- [ ] Verify against acceptance criteria
- [ ] Document results and decisions

## Hooks

Shared workspace hooks run around this prompt's execution — see [`.github/hooks/README.md`](../hooks/README.md): `session-logger`, `session-auto-commit`, `governance-audit`, `pre-exec-validate.sh`, `post-exec-state-log.py`.
