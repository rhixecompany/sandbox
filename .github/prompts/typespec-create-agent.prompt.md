## Goal

Generate a complete TypeSpec declarative agent with instructions, capabilities, and conversation starters for Microsoft 365 Copilot.

## Context

Use when you need to typespec create agent for the current workspace or task.

## Input

s

- The current workspace, repo, or document state.
- The specific request, diff, spec, or files provided by the user.
- Any prompt variables, paths, or constraints named in the original instructions.

## Output

s

- A complete result that matches the prompt's purpose.
- A concise verification note when the task benefits from one.

## Rules

> Core rules: [`templates/_shared/rules-core.md`](templates/_shared/rules-core.md)

- Follow the prompt literally and prefer evidence from the current workspace.
- Keep the response structured, deterministic, and easy to act on.
- Avoid changing unrelated files or adding unnecessary scope.
- If something is unclear, state the assumption instead of guessing.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Intake

- Read the request and identify the exact scope.
- Locate the relevant files, diffs, or references.

### Phase 2: Execute

- Perform the requested work with the smallest safe change set.
- Keep the steps explicit and reproducible.

### Phase 3: Verify

- Check the result against the goal, rules, and inputs.
- Confirm the output is usable and complete.

### Phase 4: Hand off

- Return the final artifact or findings clearly.
- Stop once the requested result is delivered.

## Requirements

> Generate a `main.tsp` file with:>
>
> 1. **Agent Declaration**

## Template Structure

> import "@typespec/http";
> import "@typespec/openapi3";

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive, role-based agent names (e.g., "Customer Support Assistant", "Research Helper")
- Write instructions in second person ("You are...")
- Be specific about the agent's expertise and limitations
- Include diverse conversation starters that showcase different features
- Only include capabilities the agent actually needs
- Scope capabilities (URLs, folders, etc.) when possible for better performance
- Use triple-quoted strings for multi-line instructions

## ExamplesAsk the user:1. What is the agent's purpose and role?2. What capabilities does it need?3. What knowledge sources should it access?4. What are typical user interactions?Then generate the complete TypeSpec agent definition.

## Template References

## Personas

See [`templates/_shared/personas.md`](templates/_shared/personas.md) for shared persona templates.

| Persona | When to Use |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Developer** | Implementation, debugging, refactoring |
| **Reviewer** | Code review, quality assurance |
| **User** | General purpose, operations |

## Personality

See [`templates/_shared/personality.md`](templates/_shared/personality.md) for shared personality guidelines.

- **Tone**: Direct, practical, actionable
- **Style**: Structured with clear steps and verification
- **Avoid**: Ambiguity, assumptions, scope creep
- **Encourage**: Evidence-based decisions, minimal changes

## Context

Use when implementing, modifying, or debugging code. Read the codebase first, understand patterns, then apply changes with tests.

## Rules

See core rules: [`templates/_shared/rules-core.md`](templates/_shared/rules-core.md)

### Domain Rules

- Read existing code before writing new code.
- Match project conventions and style.
- Add tests for new functionality.

### Standing Rules

1. **Map before touch** — Understand before making changes.
2. **Smallest safe change** — Minimal change that achieves the goal.
3. **Verify before claim** — Test before reporting complete.
4. **Report blockers** — State clearly when something fails.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Intake

- Read the request and identify scope.
- Locate relevant files, diffs, references.

### Phase 2: Execute

- Perform work with smallest safe change set.
- Keep steps explicit and reproducible.

### Phase 3: Verify

- Check result against goal, rules, inputs.
- Confirm output is usable and complete.

### Phase 4: Hand Off

- Return final artifact or findings clearly.
- Stop once the requested result is delivered.

## Best Practices

See [`templates/_shared/best-practices.md`](templates/_shared/best-practices.md) for cross-cutting best practices.

1. **DRY** — Reference shared templates instead of duplicating content.
2. **Structured output** — Use clear sections with consistent heading levels.
3. **Verification gates** — Always verify before claiming completion.
4. **Minimal changes** — Fix root cause, not symptoms.

## Verification Checklist

| # | Gate | Criterion |
| --- | ------ | ----------- |
| 1 | Scope | Change matches the original request |
| 2 | Quality | Meets project standards |
| 3 | Tests | Tests pass (if applicable) |
| 4 | Regression | No unintended side effects |
| 5 | Docs | Changes documented if needed |

## Dependencies

See [`templates/_shared/deps-core.md`](templates/_shared/deps-core.md) for shared dependency patterns.

## Goal

Generate a complete TypeSpec declarative agent with instructions, capabilities, and conversation starters for Microsoft 365 Copilot.

## Subgoals

1. **Prepare** — Understand requirements and prerequisites.
2. **Execute** — Follow structured workflow with incremental progress.
3. **Verify** — Confirm output meets requirements and standards.
4. **Document** — Record results, decisions, and lessons learned.

## Skills Required

See [`templates/_shared/skills-table-core.md`](templates/_shared/skills-table-core.md) for shared skills table.

| Skill | Purpose |
| ------- | --------- |
| `using-superpowers` | Foundational skill workflow |
| `systematic-debugging` | Root cause analysis and fix |
| `git-patch-management` | Patch creation and management |
| `executing-plans` | Execute plans step by step |
| `verification-before-completion` | Validate before claiming done |

## MCP Servers & Tools

The following MCP servers and tools are available for this task. Use them in preference to native equivalents per MCP-first tooling policy.

| `ast-grep` | AST-based code search and replace |
| `filesystem` | File read/write operations |
| `sequential-thinking` | Structured reasoning for complex problems |
| `fetch` | Web page content extraction |
| `playwright` | Browser automation for interactive pages |
| `github` | GitHub API operations |

## Tasks

- [ ] Understand requirements and scope
- [ ] Plan approach and identify resources
- [ ] Execute work incrementally
- [ ] Verify against acceptance criteria
- [ ] Document results and decisions
