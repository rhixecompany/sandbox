# React Guidelines

> Extracted from `github-copilot-starter.prompt.md`.

## React Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the React hooks rules (no conditional hooks)
- Use React.FC type for components with children
- Keep components small and focused
- Use CSS modules for component styling

```

**Prompts (.prompt.md):**

```yaml

agent: 'agent'
model: Auto (copilot)
tools: ['githubRepo', 'codebase']
description: 'Generate a new React form component'
---
Your goal is to generate a new React form component based on the templates in #githubRepo contoso/react-templates.

Ask for the form name and fields if not provided.

Requirements for the form:
* Use form design system components: [design-system/Form.md](../docs/design-system/Form.md)
* Use `react-hook-form` for form state management:
* Always define TypeScript types for your form data
* Prefer *uncontrolled* components using register
* Use `defaultValues` to prevent unnecessary rerenders
* Use `yup` for validation:
* Create reusable validation schemas in separate files
* Use TypeScript types to ensure type safety
* Customize UX-friendly validation rules

```

**Chat Modes (.agent.md):**

# Planning mode instructions
You are in planning mode. Your task is to generate an implementation plan for a new feature or for refactoring existing code.
Don't make any code edits, just generate a plan.

The plan consists of a Markdown document that describes the implementation plan, including the following sections:

* Overview: A brief description of the feature or refactoring task.
* Requirements: A list of requirements for the feature or refactoring task.
* Implementation Steps: A detailed list of steps to implement the feature or refactoring task.
* Testing: A list of tests that need to be implemented to verify the feature or refactoring task.
