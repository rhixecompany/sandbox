      feature_name:
        description: "Feature name"
        required: true
      epic_issue:
        description: "Epic issue number"
        required: true

jobs:
  create-issues:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Create Feature Issue
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            const { data: epic } = await github.rest.issues.get({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              issue_number: ${{ github.event.inputs.epic_issue }}
            });

            const featureIssue = await github.rest.issues.create({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              title: `Feature: ${{ github.event.inputs.feature_name }}`,
              body: `# Feature: ${{ github.event.inputs.feature_name }}\n\n...`,
              labels: ['feature', 'priority-medium'],
              milestone: epic.data.milestone?.number
            });
```

##### Automated Status Updates

```yaml
name: Update Issue Status

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, closed]

jobs:
  update-status:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Move to In Review
        if: github.event.action == 'opened'
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        # Move related issues to "In Review" column

      - name: Move to Done
        if: github.event.action == 'closed' && github.event.pull_request.merged
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        # Move related issues to "Done" column
