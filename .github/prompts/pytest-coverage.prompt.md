## Goal

Run pytest tests with coverage, discover lines missing coverage, and increase coverage to 100%.

## Context

Use when you need to work on the current workspace or task.

## Inputs

- The current workspace, repo, or document state.
- The specific request, diff, spec, or files provided by the user.
- Any prompt variables, paths, or constraints named in the original instructions.

## Outputs

- A complete result that matches the prompt's purpose.
- A concise verification note when the task benefits from one.

## Rules

- Follow the prompt literally and prefer evidence from the current workspace.
- Keep the response structured, deterministic, and easy to act on.
- Avoid changing unrelated files or adding unnecessary scope.
- If something is unclear, state the assumption instead of guessing.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Intake
- Read the request and identify the exact scope.
- Locate the relevant files, diffs, or references.

### Phase 2: Execute
- Perform the requested work with the smallest safe change set.
- Keep the steps explicit and reproducible.

### Phase 3: Verify
- Check the result against the goal, rules, and inputs.
- Confirm the output is usable and complete.

### Phase 4: Hand off
- Return the final artifact or findings clearly.
- Stop once the requested result is delivered.

## Legacy Prompt Details
The goal is for the tests to cover all lines of code.

Generate a coverage report with:

pytest --cov --cov-report=annotate:cov_annotate

If you are checking for coverage of a specific module, you can specify it like this:

pytest --cov=your_module_name --cov-report=annotate:cov_annotate

You can also specify specific tests to run, for example:

pytest tests/test_your_module.py --cov=your_module_name --cov-report=annotate:cov_annotate

Open the cov_annotate directory to view the annotated source code. There will be one file per source file. If a file has 100% source coverage, it means all lines are covered by tests, so you do not need to open the file.

For each file that has less than 100% test coverage, find the matching file in cov_annotate and review the file.

If a line starts with a ! (exclamation mark), it means that the line is not covered by tests. Add tests to cover the missing lines.

Keep running the tests and improving coverage until all lines are covered.
