## Goal

Create GitHub Issues for unimplemented requirements from specification files using feature_request.yml template.

## Context

Use when you need to work on the current workspace or task.

## Inputs

- The current workspace, repo, or document state.
- The specific request, diff, spec, or files provided by the user.
- Any prompt variables, paths, or constraints named in the original instructions.

## Outputs

- A complete result that matches the prompt's purpose.
- A concise verification note when the task benefits from one.

## Rules

- Follow the prompt literally and prefer evidence from the current workspace.
- Keep the response structured, deterministic, and easy to act on.
- Avoid changing unrelated files or adding unnecessary scope.
- If something is unclear, state the assumption instead of guessing.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Intake
- Read the request and identify the exact scope.
- Locate the relevant files, diffs, or references.

### Phase 2: Execute
- Perform the requested work with the smallest safe change set.
- Keep the steps explicit and reproducible.

### Phase 3: Verify
- Check the result against the goal, rules, and inputs.
- Confirm the output is usable and complete.

### Phase 4: Hand off
- Return the final artifact or findings clearly.
- Stop once the requested result is delivered.

## Legacy Prompt Details
# Create GitHub Issues for Unmet Specification Requirements

Create GitHub Issues for unimplemented requirements in the specification at `${file}`.

## Process

1. Analyze specification file to extract all requirements
2. Check codebase implementation status for each requirement
3. Search existing issues using `search_issues` to avoid duplicates
4. Create new issue per unimplemented requirement using `create_issue`
5. Use `feature_request.yml` template (fallback to default)

## Requirements

- One issue per unimplemented requirement from specification
- Clear requirement ID and description mapping
- Include implementation guidance and acceptance criteria
- Verify against existing issues before creation

## Issue Content

- Title: Requirement ID and brief description
- Description: Detailed requirement, implementation method, and context
- Labels: feature, enhancement (as appropriate)

## Implementation Check

- Search codebase for related code patterns
- Check related specification files in `/spec/` directory
- Verify requirement isn't partially implemented
