## Goal

Guide an agent (or a developer following this prompt) through setting up and using Groq Cloud: create an API key, configure the environment, make the first chat completion, choose models, use OpenAI-compatible client libraries, call the REST API, and respect rate limits. The full reference is embedded under `## Groq Cloud Reference` below.

## Subgoals

1. **Key** — Create a Groq API key and store it as an environment variable.
2. **First call** — Send a first chat completion via the Groq Python/JS SDK or raw REST.
3. **Models** — Select an appropriate model from the Supported Models reference.
4. **Compatibility** — Wire existing OpenAI client libraries to the Groq base URL.
5. **API** — Use the REST API reference for chat, files, and fine-tuning endpoints.
6. **Limits** — Apply rate-limit headers and backoff in production code.

## Personas

- **Developer** — Implementation, SDK setup, first request.
- **Reviewer** — Validating integration correctness and quota safety.
- **User** — General-purpose operations and onboarding.

## Personality

- **Tone**: Direct, practical, actionable.
- **Style**: Reference-first; cite the embedded docs for exact parameters.
- **Avoid**: Guessing model IDs or parameters not listed in the reference.
- **Encourage**: Environment-variable key storage, streaming where useful, rate-limit backoff.

## Context

The reference content was converted from `setup-groq-cloud.prompt.txt` (a concatenated scrape of Groq Cloud documentation pages). It is authoritative for model IDs, endpoints, request fields, and limits. Always prefer the values stated in `## Groq Cloud Reference` over assumptions.

## Rules

1. **DRY** — Reference the embedded docs; do not restate parameter lists inline when the reference covers them.
2. **Key safety** — Never print or commit the API key. Use `GROQ_API_KEY` env var.
3. **Verify before claim** — Confirm model IDs and endpoints against the reference before using them.
4. **Rate limits** — Honor `x-ratelimit-remaining-*` headers and `retry-after` on `429`.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Provision
- Create an API key at `https://console.groq.com/keys`.
- Export `GROQ_API_KEY` in the environment (see Reference > Quickstart).

### Phase 2: First Request
- Install the SDK (`pip install groq` or `pnpm add ai @ai-sdk/groq`).
- Send a first chat completion (see Reference > Quickstart / API Reference).

### Phase 3: Productionize
- Choose a model from Reference > Supported Models.
- Wire OpenAI-compatible clients via `base_url=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` (see Reference > OpenAI Compatibility).
- Implement rate-limit backoff (see Reference > Rate Limits).

## Best Practices

1. **Environment variables** — Keep keys out of source.
2. **Streaming** — Use `stream: true` for long generations.
3. **Structured outputs** — Prefer `response_format` JSON schema on supported models.
4. **Backoff** — Exponential backoff on `429` using `retry-after`.

## Verification Checklist

| # | Gate | Criterion |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | Key | API key created and exported as `GROQ_API_KEY` |
| 2 | First call | A chat completion returns content |
| 3 | Model | Model ID matches one in Supported Models |
| 4 | Compat | OpenAI client points at Groq base URL |
| 5 | Limits | Code handles `429` + `retry-after` |

## Skills Required

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `using-superpowers` | Foundational workflow |
| `systematic-debugging` | Root-cause API/SDK errors |
| `verification-before-completion` | Validate before claiming done |

### Quickstart

> Get up and running with the Groq API in minutes: create an API key, set up your environment, and make your first request.

Get up and running with the Groq API in a few minutes, with the steps below.

For additional support, catch our [onboarding video](https://console.groq.com/docs/overview).

### Create an API Key

Please visit [here](https://console.groq.com/keys) to create an API Key.

### Set up your API Key (recommended)

Configure your API key as an environment variable. This approach streamlines your API usage by eliminating the need to include your API key in each request. Moreover, it enhances security by minimizing the risk of inadvertently including your API key in your codebase.

#### In your terminal of choice:

```javascript
export GROQ_API_KEY=<your-api-key-here>
```

### Requesting your first chat completion

#### Install the Groq Python library:

```bash
pip install groq
```

#### Performing a Chat Completion:

```python
import os

from groq import Groq

client = Groq(
    api_key=os.environ.get("GROQ_API_KEY"),
)

chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Explain the importance of fast language models",
        }
    ],
    model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
)

print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Using third-party libraries and SDKs

#### Using AI SDK:

[AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) is a Javascript-based open-source library that simplifies building large language model (LLM) applications. Documentation for how to use Groq on the AI SDK [can be found here](https://console.groq.com/docs/ai-sdk/).

First, install the `ai` package and the Groq provider `@ai-sdk/groq`:

```bash
pnpm add ai @ai-sdk/groq
```

Then, you can use the Groq provider to generate text. By default, the provider will look for `GROQ_API_KEY` as the API key.

```javascript
import { groq } from '@ai-sdk/groq';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: groq('llama-3.3-70b-versatile'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

Now that you have successfully received a chat completion, you can try out the other endpoints in the API.

#### Next Steps

* Check out the [Playground](https://console.groq.com/playground) to try out the Groq API in your browser
* Join our GroqCloud [developer community](https://community.groq.com/)
* Add a how-to on your project to the [Groq API Cookbook](https://github.com/groq/groq-api-cookbook)

### Deprecated Models

Deprecated models are models that are no longer supported or will no longer be supported in the future. See our deprecation guidelines and deprecated models [here](https://console.groq.com/docs/deprecations).

### Get All Available Models

Hosted models are directly accessible through the GroqCloud Models API endpoint using the model IDs mentioned above. You can use the `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/models` endpoint to return a JSON list of all active models:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/models" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $GROQ_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```javascript
import Groq from "groq-sdk";

const groq = new Groq({ apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY });

const getModels = async () => {
  return await groq.models.list();
};

getModels().then((models) => {
  // console.log(models);
});
```

```python
import requests
import os

api_key = os.environ.get("GROQ_API_KEY")
url = "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/models"

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

print(response.json())
```json

### OpenAI Compatibility

> Learn how to use OpenAI's client libraries with Groq API, including configuration, supported features, and limitations.

We designed Groq API to be mostly compatible with OpenAI's client libraries, making it easy to configure your existing applications to run on Groq and try our inference speed.

We also have our own [Groq Python and Groq TypeScript libraries](https://console.groq.com/docs/libraries) that we encourage you to use.

### Configuring OpenAI to Use Groq API

To start using Groq with OpenAI's client libraries, pass your Groq API key to the `api_key` parameter and change the `base_url` to `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`:

```python
import os
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.groq.com/openai/v1",
    api_key=os.environ.get("GROQ_API_KEY")
)
```

You can find your API key [here](https://console.groq.com/keys).

### Currently Unsupported OpenAI Features

Note that although Groq API is mostly OpenAI compatible, there are a few features we don't support just yet:

#### Text Completions

The following fields are currently not supported and will result in a 400 error (yikes) if they are supplied:

* `logprobs`
* `logit_bias`
* `top_logprobs`
* `messages[].name`
* If `N` is supplied, it must be equal to 1.

#### Temperature

If you set a `temperature` value of 0, it will be converted to `1e-8`. If you run into any issues, please try setting the value to a float32 `> 0` and `<= 2`.

#### Audio Transcription and Translation

The following values are not supported:

* `vtt`
* `srt`

### Responses API

Groq also supports the [Responses API](https://console.groq.com/docs/responses-api), which is a more advanced interface for generating model responses that supports both text and image inputs while producing text outputs. You can build stateful conversations by using previous responses as context, and extend your model's capabilities through function calling to connect with external systems and data sources.

#### Feedback

If you'd like to see support for such features as the above on Groq API, please reach out to us and let us know by submitting a "Feature Request" via "Chat with us" in the menu after clicking your organization in the top right. We really value your feedback and would love to hear from you! 🤩

[Chat](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#chat)

[Create chat completion](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#chat-create)

POSThttps://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions

Creates a model response for the given chat conversation.

[Request Body](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#chat-create-request-body)

* messagesarrayRequired  
A list of messages comprising the conversation so far.  
#### Show possible types
* modelstringRequired  
ID of the model to use. For details on which models are compatible with the Chat API, see available [models](https://console.groq.com/docs/models)
* citation_optionsstring or nullOptionalDefaults to enabled  
Allowed values: `enabled, disabled`  
Whether to enable citations in the response. When enabled, the model will include citations for information retrieved from provided documents or web searches.
* compound_customobject or nullOptional  
Custom configuration of models and tools for Compound.  
#### Show properties
* disable_tool_validationbooleanOptionalDefaults to false  
If set to true, groq will return called tools without validating that the tool is present in request.tools. tool_choice=required/none will still be enforced, but the request cannot require a specific tool be used.
* documentsarray or nullOptional  
A list of documents to provide context for the conversation. Each document contains text that can be referenced by the model.  
#### Show properties
* exclude_domainsDeprecatedarray or nullOptional  
Deprecated: Use search_settings.exclude_domains instead. A list of domains to exclude from the search results when the model uses a web search tool.
* frequency_penaltynumber or nullOptionalDefaults to 0  
Range: -2 - 2  
This is not yet supported by any of our models. Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
* function_callDeprecatedstring / object or nullOptional  
Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.  
Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. `none` means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model to call that function.  
`none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if functions are present.

The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.
* max_tokensDeprecatedinteger or nullOptional  
Deprecated in favor of `max_completion_tokens`. The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.
* metadataobject or nullOptional  
This parameter is not currently supported.
* ninteger or nullOptionalDefaults to 1  
Range: 1 - 1  
How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that the current moment, only n=1 is supported. Other values will result in a 400 response.
* parallel_tool_callsboolean or nullOptionalDefaults to true  
Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.
* presence_penaltynumber or nullOptionalDefaults to 0  
Range: -2 - 2  
This is not yet supported by any of our models. Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
* reasoning_effortstring or nullOptional  
Allowed values: `none, default, low, medium, high`  
qwen3 models support the following values Set to 'none' to disable reasoning. Set to 'default' or null to let Qwen reason.

* reasoning_formatstring or nullOptional  
Allowed values: `hidden, raw, parsed`  
Specifies how to output reasoning tokens This field is mutually exclusive with `include_reasoning`.
* response_formatobject / object / object or nullOptional  
An object specifying the format that the model must output. Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. `json_schema` response format is only available on [supported models](https://console.groq.com/docs/structured-outputs#supported-models). Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables the older JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using `json_schema` is preferred for models that support it.  
#### Show possible types
* search_settingsobject or nullOptional  
Settings for web search functionality when the model uses a web search tool.  
#### Show properties
* seedinteger or nullOptional  
If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.
* service_tierstring or nullOptional  
Allowed values: `auto, on_demand, flex, performance, null`  
The service tier to use for the request. Defaults to `on_demand`.

  * `auto` will automatically select the highest tier available within the rate limits of your organization.
  * `flex` uses the flex tier, which will succeed or fail quickly.
* stopstring / array or nullOptional  
Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.  
#### Show possible types
* storeboolean or nullOptional  
This parameter is not currently supported.
* streamboolean or nullOptionalDefaults to false  
If set, partial message deltas will be sent. Tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent%5Fevents/Using%5Fserver-sent%5Fevents#Event%5Fstream%5Fformat) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message.

Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.  
#### Show properties
* temperaturenumber or nullOptionalDefaults to 1  
Range: 0 - 2  
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.
* tool_choicestring / object or nullOptional  
Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. `none` means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message. `auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. `required` means the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.  
`none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools are present.  
#### Show possible types
* toolsarray or nullOptional  
A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.

Range: 0 - 20  
This is not yet supported by any of our models. An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.
* top_pnumber or nullOptionalDefaults to 1  
Range: 0 - 1  
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

If set to 0, the model will use [log probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log%5Fprobability) to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit.
* timestamp_granularities\[\]arrayOptionalDefaults to segment  
The timestamp granularities to populate for this transcription. `response_format` must be set `verbose_json` to use timestamp granularities. Either or both of these options are supported: `word`, or `segment`. Note: There is no additional latency for segment timestamps, but generating word timestamps incurs additional latency.
* urlstringOptional  
The audio URL to translate/transcribe (supports Base64URL). Either a file or a URL must be provided. For Batch API requests, the URL field is required since the file field is not supported.

### Rate Limits

> Understand Groq API rate limits, headers, and best practices for managing request and token quotas in your applications.

Rate limits act as control measures to regulate how frequently users and applications can access our API within specified timeframes. These limits help ensure service stability, fair access, and protection against misuse so that we can serve reliable and fast inference for all.

### Understanding Rate Limits

Rate limits are measured in:

* **RPM:** Requests per minute
* **RPD:** Requests per day
* **TPM:** Tokens per minute
* **TPD:** Tokens per day
* **ASH:** Audio seconds per hour
* **ASD:** Audio seconds per day
* **ITPM:** Input tokens per minute
* **OTPM:** Output tokens per minute

[Cached tokens](https://console.groq.com/docs/prompt-caching) do not count towards your rate limits.

Rate limits apply at the organization level, not individual users. You can hit any limit type depending on which threshold you reach first.

**Example:** Let's say your RPM = 50 and your TPM = 200K. If you were to send 50 requests with only 100 tokens within a minute, you would reach your limit even though you did not send 200K tokens within those 50 requests.

#### Input and Output Token Rate Limits (ITPM / OTPM)

In addition to the combined TPM limit, some organizations are also subject to separate per-minute limits on input tokens (ITPM) and output tokens (OTPM). For example, an OTPM limit caps how many completion tokens your organization can generate per minute, regardless of how many input tokens are sent.

If these limits are configured on your account, you'll see your TPM value on the [Limits page](https://console.groq.com/settings/limits) — hover over it to see the **"X in / Y out"** breakdown. If no breakdown appears, your organization has a single combined TPM cap with no separate input/output limits.

### Rate Limits

The following is a high level summary and there may be exceptions to these limits. You can view the current, exact rate limits for your organization on the [limits page](https://console.groq.com/settings/limits) in your account settings.

**Need higher rate limits?** Upgrade to [Developer plan](https://console.groq.com/settings/billing/plans) to access higher limits, [Batch](https://console.groq.com/docs/batch) and [Flex](https://console.groq.com/docs/flex-processing) processing, and more. Note that the limits shown below are the base limits for the Developer plan, and higher limits are available for select workloads and enterprise use cases.

### Rate Limit Headers

In addition to viewing your limits on your account's [limits](https://console.groq.com/settings/limits) page, you can also view rate limit information such as remaining requests and tokens in HTTP response headers as follows:

The following headers are set (values are illustrative):

| Header                         | Value    | Notes                                    |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| retry-after                    | 2        | In seconds                               |
| x-ratelimit-limit-requests     | 14400    | Always refers to Requests Per Day (RPD)  |
| x-ratelimit-limit-tokens       | 18000    | Always refers to Tokens Per Minute (TPM) |
| x-ratelimit-remaining-requests | 14370    | Always refers to Requests Per Day (RPD)  |
| x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens   | 17997    | Always refers to Tokens Per Minute (TPM) |
| x-ratelimit-reset-requests     | 2m59.56s | Always refers to Requests Per Day (RPD)  |
| x-ratelimit-reset-tokens       | 7.66s    | Always refers to Tokens Per Minute (TPM) |

### Handling Rate Limits

When you exceed rate limits, our API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP status code.

**Note**: `retry-after` is only set if you hit the rate limit and status code 429 is returned. The other headers are always included.
