## Goal

Get best practices for developing applications with Spring Boot.

# Spring Boot Best PracticesYour goal is to help me write high-quality Spring Boot applications by following established best practices.

## Project Setup & Structure

- **Build Tool:** Use Maven (`pom.xml`) or Gradle (`build.gradle`) for dependency management.- **Starters:** Use Spring Boot starters (e.g., `spring-boot-starter-web`, `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`) to simplify dependency management.- **Package Structure:** Organize code by feature/domain (e.g., `com.example.app.order`, `com.example.app.user`) rather than by layer (e.g., `com.example.app.controller`, `com.example.app.service`).

## Dependency Injection & Components

- **Constructor Injection:** Always use constructor-based injection for required dependencies. This makes components easier to test and dependencies explicit.- **Immutability:** Declare dependency fields as `private final`.- **Component Stereotypes:** Use `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller`/`@RestController` annotations appropriately to define beans.

## Configuration

- **Externalized Configuration:** Use `application.yml` (or `application.properties`) for configuration. YAML is often preferred for its readability and hierarchical structure.- **Type-Safe Properties:** Use `@ConfigurationProperties` to bind configuration to strongly-typed Java objects.- **Profiles:** Use Spring Profiles (`application-dev.yml`, `application-prod.yml`) to manage environment-specific configurations.- **Secrets Management:** Do not hardcode secrets. Use environment variables, or a dedicated secret management tool like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

## Web Layer (Controllers)

- **RESTful APIs:** Design clear and consistent RESTful endpoints.- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):** Use DTOs to expose and consume data in the API layer. Do not expose JPA entities directly to the client.- **Validation:** Use Java Bean Validation (JSR 380) with annotations (`@Valid`, `@NotNull`, `@Size`) on DTOs to validate request payloads.- **Error Handling:** Implement a global exception handler using `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler` to provide consistent error responses.

## Service Layer

- **Business Logic:** Encapsulate all business logic within `@Service` classes.- **Statelessness:** Services should be stateless.- **Transaction Management:** Use `@Transactional` on service methods to manage database transactions declaratively. Apply it at the most granular level necessary.

## Data Layer (Repositories)

- **Spring Data JPA:** Use Spring Data JPA repositories by extending `JpaRepository` or `CrudRepository` for standard database operations.- **Custom Queries:** For complex queries, use `@Query` or the JPA Criteria API.- **Projections:** Use DTO projections to fetch only the necessary data from the database.

## Logging

- **SLF4J:** Use the SLF4J API for logging.- **Logger Declaration:** `private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyClass.class);`- **Parameterized Logging:** Use parameterized messages (`logger.info("Processing user {}...", userId);`) instead of string concatenation to improve performance.

## Test

ing

- **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for services and components using JUnit 5 and a mocking framework like Mockito.
- **Integration Tests:** Use `@SpringBootTest` for integration tests that load the Spring application context.
- **Test Slices:** Use test slice annotations like `@WebMvcTest` (for controllers) or `@DataJpaTest` (for repositories) to test specific parts of the application in isolation.
- **Testcontainers:** Consider using Testcontainers for reliable integration tests with real databases, message brokers, etc.

## Security

- **Spring Security:** Use Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
- **Password Encoding:** Always encode passwords using a strong hashing algorithm like BCrypt.
- **Input Sanitization:** Prevent SQL injection by using Spring Data JPA or parameterized queries. Prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by properly encoding output.

## Template References

Templates in `templates/java-springboot/`:- `configuration.md`- `data_layer_repositories.md`- `dependency_injection__com.md`- `logging.md`- `project_setup__structure.md`- `security.md`- `service_layer.md`- `testing.md`- `web_layer_controllers.md`

## Personas

See [`templates/_shared/personas.md`](templates/_shared/personas.md) for shared persona templates.

| Persona | When to Use |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Developer** | Implementation, debugging, refactoring |
| **Reviewer** | Code review, quality assurance |
| **User** | General purpose, operations |

## Personality

See [`templates/_shared/personality.md`](templates/_shared/personality.md) for shared personality guidelines.

- **Tone**: Direct, practical, actionable
- **Style**: Structured with clear steps and verification
- **Avoid**: Ambiguity, assumptions, scope creep
- **Encourage**: Evidence-based decisions, minimal changes

## Context

Use when implementing, modifying, or debugging code. Read the codebase first, understand patterns, then apply changes with tests.

## Rules

See core rules: [`templates/_shared/rules-core.md`](templates/_shared/rules-core.md)

### Domain Rules

- Read existing code before writing new code.
- Match project conventions and style.
- Add tests for new functionality.

### Standing Rules

1. **Map before touch** — Understand before making changes.
2. **Smallest safe change** — Minimal change that achieves the goal.
3. **Verify before claim** — Test before reporting complete.
4. **Report blockers** — State clearly when something fails.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Intake

- Read the request and identify scope.
- Locate relevant files, diffs, references.

### Phase 2: Execute

- Perform work with smallest safe change set.
- Keep steps explicit and reproducible.

### Phase 3: Verify

- Check result against goal, rules, inputs.
- Confirm output is usable and complete.

### Phase 4: Hand Off

- Return final artifact or findings clearly.
- Stop once the requested result is delivered.

## Best Practices

See [`templates/_shared/best-practices.md`](templates/_shared/best-practices.md) for cross-cutting best practices.

1. **DRY** — Reference shared templates instead of duplicating content.
2. **Structured output** — Use clear sections with consistent heading levels.
3. **Verification gates** — Always verify before claiming completion.
4. **Minimal changes** — Fix root cause, not symptoms.

## Verification Checklist

| # | Gate | Criterion |
| --- | ------ | ----------- |
| 1 | Scope | Change matches the original request |
| 2 | Quality | Meets project standards |
| 3 | Tests | Tests pass (if applicable) |
| 4 | Regression | No unintended side effects |
| 5 | Docs | Changes documented if needed |

## Dependencies

See [`templates/_shared/deps-core.md`](templates/_shared/deps-core.md) for shared dependency patterns.

## Subgoals

1. **Prepare** — Understand requirements and prerequisites.
2. **Execute** — Follow structured workflow with incremental progress.
3. **Verify** — Confirm output meets requirements and standards.
4. **Document** — Record results, decisions, and lessons learned.

## Skills Required

See [`templates/_shared/skills-table-core.md`](templates/_shared/skills-table-core.md) for shared skills table.

| Skill | Purpose |
| ------- | --------- |
| `using-superpowers` | Foundational skill workflow |
| `systematic-debugging` | Root cause analysis and fix |
| `git-patch-management` | Patch creation and management |
| `executing-plans` | Execute plans step by step |
| `verification-before-completion` | Validate before claiming done |

## MCP Servers & Tools

The following MCP servers and tools are available for this task. Use them in preference to native equivalents per MCP-first tooling policy.

| `ast-grep` | AST-based code search and replace |
| `filesystem` | File read/write operations |
| `sequential-thinking` | Structured reasoning for complex problems |
| `fetch` | Web page content extraction |
| `playwright` | Browser automation for interactive pages |
| `github` | GitHub API operations |

## Tasks

- [ ] Understand requirements and scope
- [ ] Plan approach and identify resources
- [ ] Execute work incrementally
- [ ] Verify against acceptance criteria
- [ ] Document results and decisions
