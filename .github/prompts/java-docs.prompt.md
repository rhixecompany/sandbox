## Goal

Ensure that Java types are documented with Javadoc comments and follow best practices for documentation.

# Java Documentation (Javadoc) Best Practices- Public and protected members should be documented with Javadoc comments.

- It is encouraged to document package-private and private members as well, especially if they are complex or not self-explanatory.
- The first sentence of the Javadoc comment is the summary description. It should be a concise overview of what the method does and end with a period.
- Use `@param` for method parameters. The description starts with a lowercase letter and does not end with a period.
- Use `@return` for method return values.
- Use `@throws` or `@exception` to document exceptions thrown by methods.
- Use `@see` for references to other types or members.
- Use `{@inheritDoc}` to inherit documentation from base classes or interfaces.  - Unless there is major behavior change, in which case you should document the differences.
- Use `@param <T>` for type parameters in generic types or methods.
- Use `{@code}` for inline code snippets.
- Use `<pre>{@code ... }</pre>` for code blocks.
- Use `@since` to indicate when the feature was introduced (e.g., version number).- Use `@version` to specify the version of the member.
- Use `@author` to specify the author of the code.
- Use `@deprecated` to mark a member as deprecated and provide an alternative.

## Personas

See [`templates/_shared/personas.md`](templates/_shared/personas.md) for shared persona templates.

| Persona | When to Use |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Developer** | Implementation, debugging, refactoring |
| **Reviewer** | Code review, quality assurance |
| **User** | General purpose, operations |

## Personality

See [`templates/_shared/personality.md`](templates/_shared/personality.md) for shared personality guidelines.

- **Tone**: Direct, practical, actionable
- **Style**: Structured with clear steps and verification
- **Avoid**: Ambiguity, assumptions, scope creep
- **Encourage**: Evidence-based decisions, minimal changes

## Context

Use when implementing, modifying, or debugging code. Read the codebase first, understand patterns, then apply changes with tests.

## Rules

See core rules: [`templates/_shared/rules-core.md`](templates/_shared/rules-core.md)

### Domain Rules

- Read existing code before writing new code.
- Match project conventions and style.
- Add tests for new functionality.

### Standing Rules

1. **Map before touch** — Understand before making changes.
2. **Smallest safe change** — Minimal change that achieves the goal.
3. **Verify before claim** — Test before reporting complete.
4. **Report blockers** — State clearly when something fails.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Intake

- Read the request and identify scope.
- Locate relevant files, diffs, references.

### Phase 2: Execute

- Perform work with smallest safe change set.
- Keep steps explicit and reproducible.

### Phase 3: Verify

- Check result against goal, rules, inputs.
- Confirm output is usable and complete.

### Phase 4: Hand Off

- Return final artifact or findings clearly.
- Stop once the requested result is delivered.

## Best Practices

See [`templates/_shared/best-practices.md`](templates/_shared/best-practices.md) for cross-cutting best practices.

1. **DRY** — Reference shared templates instead of duplicating content.
2. **Structured output** — Use clear sections with consistent heading levels.
3. **Verification gates** — Always verify before claiming completion.
4. **Minimal changes** — Fix root cause, not symptoms.

## Verification Checklist

| # | Gate | Criterion |
| --- | ------ | ----------- |
| 1 | Scope | Change matches the original request |
| 2 | Quality | Meets project standards |
| 3 | Tests | Tests pass (if applicable) |
| 4 | Regression | No unintended side effects |
| 5 | Docs | Changes documented if needed |

## Dependencies

See [`templates/_shared/deps-core.md`](templates/_shared/deps-core.md) for shared dependency patterns.

## Subgoals

1. **Prepare** — Understand requirements and prerequisites.
2. **Execute** — Follow structured workflow with incremental progress.
3. **Verify** — Confirm output meets requirements and standards.
4. **Document** — Record results, decisions, and lessons learned.

## Skills Required

See [`templates/_shared/skills-table-core.md`](templates/_shared/skills-table-core.md) for shared skills table.

| Skill | Purpose |
| ------- | --------- |
| `using-superpowers` | Foundational skill workflow |
| `systematic-debugging` | Root cause analysis and fix |
| `git-patch-management` | Patch creation and management |
| `executing-plans` | Execute plans step by step |
| `verification-before-completion` | Validate before claiming done |

## MCP Servers & Tools

The following MCP servers and tools are available for this task. Use them in preference to native equivalents per MCP-first tooling policy.

| `ast-grep` | AST-based code search and replace |
| `filesystem` | File read/write operations |
| `sequential-thinking` | Structured reasoning for complex problems |
| `fetch` | Web page content extraction |
| `playwright` | Browser automation for interactive pages |
| `github` | GitHub API operations |

## Tasks

- [ ] Understand requirements and scope
- [ ] Plan approach and identify resources
- [ ] Execute work incrementally
- [ ] Verify against acceptance criteria
- [ ] Document results and decisions
