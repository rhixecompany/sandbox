## Goal
Write implementation plans: bite-sized tasks, paths, code.


# Writing Implementation Plans

## Workflow
### Phase 1: Preparation

- Understand the context and requirements.
- Gather necessary tools and resources.

### Phase 2: Execution

- Perform the core actions required by the skill.
- Apply the techniques and procedures outlined.

### Phase 3: Verification

- Verify the results against the expected outcomes.
- Confirm that the task has been completed successfully.


## Overview


Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the implementer has zero context for the codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need: which files to touch, complete code, testing commands, docs to check, how to verify. Give them bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

Assume the implementer is a skilled developer but knows almost nothing about the toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Core principle:** A good plan makes implementation obvious. If someone has to guess, the plan is incomplete.

## When to Use

**Always use before:**
- Implementing multi-step features
- Breaking down complex requirements
- Delegating to subagents via subagent-driven-development

**Don't skip when:**
- Feature seems simple (assumptions cause bugs)
- You plan to implement it yourself (future you needs guidance)
- Working alone (documentation matters)

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each task = 2-5 minutes of focused work.**

Every step is one action:
- "Write the failing test" — step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" — step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" — step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" — step
- "Commit" — step

**Too big:**
```markdown
### Task 1: Build authentication system
[50 lines of code across 5 files]
```

**Right size:**
```markdown
### Task 1: Create User model with email field
[10 lines, 1 file]

### Task 2: Add password hash field to User
[8 lines, 1 file]

### Task 3: Create password hashing utility
[15 lines, 1 file]
```

## Plan Document Structure

### Header (Required)

Every plan MUST start with:

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For Hermes:** Use subagent-driven-development skill to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

---
```

### Task Structure

Each task follows this format:

````markdown
### Task N: [Descriptive Name]

**Objective:** What this task accomplishes (one sentence)

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/new_file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:45-67` (line numbers if known)
- Test: `tests/path/to/test_file.py`

**Step 1: Write failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

**Step 2: Run test to verify failure**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_specific_behavior -v`
Expected: FAIL — "function not defined"

**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

**Step 4: Run test to verify pass**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_specific_behavior -v`
Expected: PASS

**Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```

## Workflow

| Step | Action | Detailed Reference |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Understand requirements + prerequisites | `references/implementation-plan-contract.md` |
| 2 | Check prerequisite artifacts | `references/body-reference.md` |
| 3 | Explore codebase | `references/body-reference.md` |
| 4 | Design approach | `references/body-reference.md` |
| 5 | Write bite-sized tasks | `references/body-reference.md` |
| 6 | Review and save | `references/body-reference.md` |
| 7 | Save plan + commit | `references/body-reference.md` |

## Body Reference

Detailed body guidance has been moved to `references/body-reference.md`. That file is the source of truth for long-form instructions, examples, and phase-specific procedures.

1. If the user requests expanded instructions, open `references/body-reference.md`.
2. Do not inline long examples or recap procedures here.
3. Keep this SKILL.md as the index/table of contents.

## Cross-Platform Notes

- Use env-based paths (`$HOME`, `%USERPROFILE%`) for paths.
- Respect per-project conventions in AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md.

## Capability Checklist

- [ ] Create a plan document before executing implementation work.
- [ ] Use bite-sized task granularity and exact file paths.
- [ ] Provide exact commands and expected outputs before applying changes.

## Remember

```
Bite-sized tasks (2-5 min each)
Exact file paths
Complete code (copy-pasteable)
Exact commands with expected output
Verification steps
DRY, YAGNI, TDD
Frequent commits
```

**A good plan makes implementation obvious.**




## Pitfalls

- **Stale cache:** Always re-read files from disk after editing; don't rely on cached context
- **Context limits:** Process in batches; write results after each batch
## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Frontmatter complete (name, title, description, version, author, license, tags)
- [ ] Skills Required table present
- [ ] Workflow has ≥3 phases
- [ ] Pitfalls section present
- [ ] All references cited in SKILL.md body
- [ ] SKILL.md is under 250 lines
- [ ] No placeholder text

## Best Practices

1. **Prepare before executing**: Ensure all prerequisites and dependencies are in place
2. **Validate inputs**: Check configuration, parameters, and environment before running
3. **Handle errors gracefully**: Implement proper error handling and recovery
4. **Document results**: Keep records of what was done, what worked, and what didn't
5. **Clean up**: Remove temporary files, release resources after completion
