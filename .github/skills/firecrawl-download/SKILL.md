Combines site mapping and scraping into organized local directories.

# firecrawl download

> **Experimental.** Convenience command that combines `map` + `scrape` to save an entire site as local files.

Maps the site first to discover pages, then scrapes each one into nested directories under `.firecrawl/`. All scrape options work with download. Always pass `-y` to skip the confirmation prompt.


## When to Use

- When you need to automate or structure workflows for `firecrawl-download`.
- When executing multi-step tasks that benefit from phased orchestration.
- When you need deterministic, verifiable tool execution.

## Overview

Automated reasoning and workflow tool for `firecrawl-download`. Execute multi-step tasks with deterministic quality controls and structured outputs.

## When to use

- You want to save an entire site (or section) to local files
- You need offline access to documentation or content
- Bulk content extraction with organized file structure

## Quick start

```bash
# Interactive wizard (picks format, screenshots, paths for you)
firecrawl download https://docs.example.com

# With screenshots
firecrawl download https://docs.example.com --screenshot --limit 20 -y

# Multiple formats (each saved as its own file per page)
firecrawl download https://docs.example.com --format markdown,links --screenshot --limit 20 -y
# Creates per page: index.md + links.txt + screenshot.png

# Filter to specific sections
firecrawl download https://docs.example.com --include-paths "/features,/sdks"

# Skip translations
firecrawl download https://docs.example.com --exclude-paths "/zh,/ja,/fr,/es,/pt-BR"

# Full combo
firecrawl download https://docs.example.com \
  --include-paths "/features,/sdks" \
  --exclude-paths "/zh,/ja" \
  --only-main-content \
  --screenshot \
  -y
```

## Pitfalls

- **None identified yet** — Review edge cases and failure modes for this skill's domain.
- **Assumptions** — Verify platform compatibility (Windows/Mac/Linux) before relying on default paths.
- **State management** — Terminal state persists across calls; exported vars and working directory carry forward.
- **Error handling** — Always validate tool output before proceeding to the next step.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Prerequisites and environment are properly configured
- [ ] Firecrawl Download operations completed successfully
- [ ] Output meets expected quality and requirements
- [ ] Any errors during execution were resolved
- [ ] Changes are documented and committed if applicable

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Preparation

Set up required environment, dependencies, and configuration for Firecrawl Download.

### Phase 2: Execution

Run the primary Firecrawl Download operations according to the defined requirements.

### Phase 3: Verification

Verify output, handle any errors, and confirm results meet expectations.

### Phase 4: Completion

Document results, clean up resources, and finalize any deliverables.

## Best Practices

1. **Prepare before executing**: Ensure all prerequisites and dependencies are in place
2. **Validate inputs**: Check configuration, parameters, and environment before running
3. **Handle errors gracefully**: Implement proper error handling and recovery
4. **Document results**: Keep records of what was done, what worked, and what didn't
5. **Clean up**: Remove temporary files, release resources after completion
